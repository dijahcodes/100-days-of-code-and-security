# 100 Days of Code and Security
I'm making a commitment to do the infamous #100 Day of Code challenge but with a twist. Over the next 100 Days, I'll commit not only to coding for an hour per day, but I'll also commit to studying an aspect of cyber security each day for an hour as well.


Here is [the Official website](http://100daysofcode.com/) for the #100DaysOfCode movement if you're interested in learning more about the movement, or starting your own #100days journey. 




## Commitment

I, Dijah, will code for at least an hour every day and study/practice something cyber-security-related for another hour for the next 100 days.

Start Date: 10/9/2023
## Rules

(This is a modified version of the rules from the #100 Days of Code Github Repo found [here:](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/rules.md) )

1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtags #100DaysOfCode and #100daysofSecurity

2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.

3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.

4. I will log my progress in this repository and share a link to my progress on Twitter. 
(I may add other links over time as well!)

5. ~~I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses, and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.~~ 

I'm not going to follow this. While I plan on doing as many projects over the next 100 days, I also want to focus on going through classes, books, tutorials, and other resources to strengthen my skills. I won't rely on tutorials and courses but if I have some rough days, I will give myself slack there so that I don't give up early.

I have ADHD and OCD, so I'm trying to plan ahead here.

## Log

As days come, I'll modify this area to show my progress!
